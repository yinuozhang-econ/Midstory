       The 'Master File' for each year contains a complete listing of the

     file, is carryover data from stoppages beginning in previous years and          
     running into the current year. These are readily recognizable by the            
     first two digits of the case number - Columns 1-2. This will be different       
     from the current year, which is indicated in Column 23-24 - YEAR.

                       to indicate the the level of carryover. For lines

                       continue into a new year, the number in column 8              
                       represents the number of years the strike has

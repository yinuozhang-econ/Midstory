- First step: run setup.do to set up the environment
- Second step: run the read*.do files.
  This is to process the .dat file. All of them are automatically generated by IPUMS
  - readData.do
  - readData2.do
    - This exists because I forgot to include INDNAICS in my variable selection
    - note that this is unnecessary if you include INDNAICS in your selection
    - In the final output I actually didn't utilize INDNAICS so it's fine to not even run it...
- Third step: run creatStat.do to produce the output.csv
